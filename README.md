# calculusClimber

[Backstory] 
While I was a Junior in Highschool, I was tasked with a final project for AP Calculus AB. Find a implementation of Calculus that is overlooked in modern society. It was a final project that was supposed to be fun, and a relief from the AP Exams. Examples that other people did were: model a building using a formula, utilizing a formula to solve crime, the science behind how snowflakes form. Ect. ect. While this project was assigned, my advanced programming teacher assigned a similar project instructing that we make a simplistic game using a platform similar to Scratch, while excusable for a high school class, I wanted to make a game implementing multiplayer at the very least, and given her approval. Merged both projects into one.

Given two weeks time, and knowing nothing about sockets.io, nor gameloops in HTML5 while vaguely being familiar with Express web servers, this is what I've created. I've changed very little since, not out of hesistance to upkeep the project, but I feel this is a good indicator of my desire to implement newly changing technologies. Enjoy.
